11-layer mechanistic hydrology ("CWRR") simulations based on the Richards' scheme produced with ORCHIDEE v2.0 (r3274). 

Three different sets of simulations:
1) Bare soil evaporation resistance term (DO_RSOIL) not activated. (Most of the comparisons in HESS paper).
2) Bare soil evaporation resistance term (DO_RSOIL) activated. (Fig. 8 and Fig. S10))
3) Reduction of bare soil fraction. (Fig. S9)
4) (2) and (3) combined.  (Fig. S11).
